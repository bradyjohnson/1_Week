				<p>Flexible box layout (or flexbox) is a new box model optimized for UI layout. As one of the first CSS modules designed for actual layout (floats were really meant mostly for things such as wrapping text around images), it makes a lot of tasks much easier, or even possible at all. Flexbox’s repertoire includes the simple centering of elements (both horizontally and vertically), the expansion and contraction of elements to fill available space, and source-code independent layout, among others abilities.
				</p>
				<p>Flexbox has lived a storied existence. It started as a feature of Mozilla’s XUL, where it was used to lay out application UI, such as the toolbars in Firefox, and it has since been rewritten multiple times. The specification has only recently reached stability, and we have fairly complete support across the latest versions of the leading browsers.
